# Snakes And Ladders

This is one of my oldest projects which started in mid-2014 when I started advancing in C++. 

Here is the description and features of the game as described by me then:

## Introduction

This is a C++ program aimed at bringing the old world charm to the new world. With the new tech savvy gen becoming moms and dads, the kids are busy playing Subway surfers and candy crush and the game which originated in India itself is losing its charm and glory. I have created this program to make this popular among the phone and the laptop savvy kids

This game is the exact version of snakes and ladders with a checked board, attractive 3D buttons and colourful animations. Currently it's a two player game which can save a game if it is left half played and recover a lost game in case of a mishap.

## Features:

1.	Attractive **3-D design** and drop shadows.

4.	Beautiful animations on the board for each move to make it feel that the player himself is playing.

5.	**“Save Games”** midway and continue exactly where you left off anytime.

6.	**Never lose a game** due to accidental power loss or mishap with the **“Auto Save”** feature that recovers any accidentally lost game.
